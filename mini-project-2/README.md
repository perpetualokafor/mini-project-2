# Miniproject 2

### [Assignment](assignment.md)

## Project/Goals
To find the top 10 coffee shops in my POI from Foursquare and Yelp

## Process
I first created a YELP API account and was able to get the information I needed from the result. I parse through the result data and generated a csv file and db table with the information I needed. I repeated this same process for Foursquare API


## Results
Yelp API provided the ratings for the coffee restaurants in my area and I was able to get the top 10 based on rating and review count but couldn't get this information from Foursquare as I ran out of credit and needed to pay extra to gain access. I would say Yelp API had the best coverage in my area based on what I was looking for and was also easier to work with.

## Challenges 
There are not enough informations provided for this project. Foursquare API for example no longer operates the way it was before and it was diffocult navigating that. It would be great if lighthouse labs could pay for access to some of the API's sites so we can actually do the work. Afterall we paid tuition fee.

## Future Goals
I would have practiced my API's data wrangling more.
